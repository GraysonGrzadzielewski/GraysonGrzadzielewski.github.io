                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning as an intern for Ace Info Solutionss' PaaS team in 2019,
                    I worked with engineers to develop reporting APIs, maintained internal
                    tools written in Python, and migrated existing infrastructure to 
                    containerized infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After my graduation from Shepherd University in 2020, I was hired as 
                    a full time System Engineer supporting the early stages of the PaaS 
                    3.0(later Srvci and CCS) project. I quickly transitioned into a 
                    Subject Matter Expert role and took on additional responsibilities 
                    such as installing and configuring the full DevOps pipeline, 
                    ensuring replication and parity of infrastructure in a multi-cluster
                    /multi-network environment with IaC, and extensive scripting for 
                    automating routine admin tasks. I also took on responsibility for 
                    cluster compliance, maintaining Active Directory and Red Hat SSO as 
                    authentication, cluster RBACs, ownership of all 30+ customer 
                    available base images, and ownership of all internal Helm charts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continued my work through Ace Info's purchase by Dovel, and 
                    then the acquisition of Dovel by Guidehouse. When Guidehouse lost 
                    the bid for the USCG IMS contract to Peraton, I transitioned to the 
                    new contract as CCS team co-lead where I continued my previous work 
                    with the addition of reporting and stakeholder communication 
                    responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Karthik Consulting, as part of the USCG Software Factory project I 
                    implemented advanced permissions in DevOps tools and EKS clusters and
                    kept the onboarding process up to date with evolving requirements. I 
                    maintained multiple components of the GitLab CI/CD pipeline and 
                    assisted with the install of ACS for ongoing compliance. I was also
                    responisble for mainatining compiance with ACS scans for eventual ATO.
                </p>
