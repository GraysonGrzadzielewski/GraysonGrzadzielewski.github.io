                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning as an intern for Ace Info Solutions's PaaS team in 2019,
                    I worked with engineers to develop reporting APIs, maintained internal
                    tools written in Python, and migrated existing infrastructure to 
                    containerized infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After my graduation from Shepherd University in 2020, I was hired as 
                    a full time System Engineer supporting the early stages of the PaaS 
                    3.0(later Srvci and CCS) project. I quickly transitioned into a 
                    Subject Matter Expert role and took on additional responsibilities 
                    such as installing and configuring the full DevOps pipeline, 
                    ensuring replication and pairty of infrastructure in a multi-cluster
                    /multi-network environment with IaC, and extensive scripting for 
                    automating routine admin tasks. I also took on responsibility for 
                    cluster compliance, maintaining Active Directory and Red Hat SSO as 
                    authentication, cluster RBACs, ownership of all 30+ customer 
                    available base images, and ownership of all internal Helm charts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continued my work through the Ace Info was purchase by Dovel, and 
                    then the acquisition of Dovel by Guidehouse. When Guidehouse lost 
                    the bid for the USCG IMS contract to Peraton, I transitioned to the 
                    new contract as CCS team co-lead where I continued my previous work 
                    with the addition of reporting and stakeholder communication 
                    responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Karthik Consulting, as part of the USCG Software Factory project I 
                    implemented advanced permissions in DevOps tools and EKS clusters and
                    kept the onboarding process up to date with evolving requirements. I 
                    maintained multiple components of the GitLab CI/CD pipeline and 
                    assisted with the install of ACS for ongoing compliance. I was also
                    responisble for mainatining compiance with ACS scans for eventual ATO.
